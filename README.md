## 🔧 Installation

1.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/google-keep-clone.git
cd google-keep-clone

2. npm install


3. npm start

How It Works
The CreateArea component handles note creation with a dynamic input area.

Notes are managed using React state in App.js.

Each note is rendered via the Note component.

Count shows how many notes are in the "database".

 Future Improvements
Add search functionality

Add tags or labels

Persist notes with localStorage or Firebase

Add dark mode toggle
